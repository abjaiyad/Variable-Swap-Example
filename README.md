# Variable Swap Example

This repository, created by Amad Bin Jaiyad, contains a simple example demonstrating how to swap variables in C++.

## Description

The `Variable-Swap-Example` repository shows how to swap the values of two variables using different methods in C++.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (optional, if you use the provided CMakeLists.txt)

### Building the Project

If you are using the provided `CMakeLists.txt`:

1. Create a build directory:
    ```sh
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```
2. Run CMake to configure the project:
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```
3. Build the project:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

Alternatively, you can compile the source files directly using a C++ compiler:
```sh
g++ -o variable_swap main.cpp
```

### Running the Example

After building the project, you can run the example by executing the generated binary:

```sh
./variable_swap
```

## Methods for Swapping Variables

This example demonstrates the following methods for swapping variables:

1. Using a temporary variable
2. Using arithmetic operations
3. Using bitwise XOR
